# Building Thoughtful ML Experiences
In recent years, machine learning has become crucial in shaping how we interact with devices and services. However, building machine learning applications that prioritize the needs and privacy of users can be a complex and challenging task. 
This talk will explore how to use Core ML and Create ML to develop user-centred machine learning experiences using Apple platforms. 

We will focus on the advantages of using on-device machine learning, including speed and privacy benefits over cloud-based approaches. 
We will also discuss making machine learning accessible and inclusive for all users, regardless of technical background. 
Additionally, we will delve into privacy in machine learning and how to design applications that respect user data and maintain trust. 

Join us to discover how to build thoughtful and user-centred machine-learning experiences for Apple platforms.
